## Advanced SQL Practice Reflection

In this activity, I learned how to combine data from multiple tables using JOINs and how to summarize data using GROUP BY with aggregate functions like COUNT and SUM. I also practiced filtering grouped results using HAVING and writing subqueries to create dynamic conditions.

The most challenging part was understanding when to use WHERE versus HAVING and structuring subqueries correctly, but practicing real examples helped make the concepts clearer.
